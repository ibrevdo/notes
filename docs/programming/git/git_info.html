<p>===== GIT terms =====</p>
<p>=== commit ===
is being created after changing files/adding new files and putting them into staging area. 
A commit is a snapshot of a working directory.
All commits live in <strong>objects </strong>direcory</p>
<p>=== caret ^ ===
a parent of a commit
For example, to resotore a deleted file:
''&gt; git checkout <deleting_commit>^ -- <deleted_file_path>''</p>
<p>=== remote ===
means a remote repository on other server
add a remote repository to your known remotes with:
''&gt; git remote add <remote name> <repository url>''
origin - a default name of a remote from where a local reposity was cloned</p>
<p>=== branch ===
Every repository has at least one branch
master is a default branch in a repositry</p>
<p>''remotes/origin/HEAD -&gt; origin/master''</p>
<p>''&gt; git push <remote name> <local branch>''</p>
<p>See all local and remote branches
''&gt; git branch -a''</p>
<p>See all known branches
''&gt; git branch -r''</p>
<p>branches and tags are a pointers to a commit</p>
<p>=== HEAD ===
HEAD is a ref (reference) to the last commit in the currently checked-out branch
Normally, it's actually a symbolic ref to checked-out branch, because a branch itself is a ref to a commit at the tip of the branch.
In that case a content of a HEAD is something like:
''ref: refs/heads/master''</p>
<p><strong>detached HEAD </strong>- happens when you check out something besides a local branch. Like a remote branch, a specific commit, a tag.
In that case a HEAD becomes a direct ref to a commit.
The contents of HEAD will be a SHA1 hash.</p>
<p><strong>HEAD^</strong> means the first <strong>parent</strong> of the tip of the current branch.</p>
